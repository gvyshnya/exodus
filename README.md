# Introduction

This repo contains a single notebook at the momeent. It is intended to explore the data about large corporate business reacting to the cruel war in Ukraine in terms of them either withdrawing their operations from russia or continueing to do the 'business as usual'.

Such data are packaged as a Kaggle dataset per https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stereobooster/yale-som . Such a dataset itself is the authorized copy of the original Yale SOM dataset per https://som.yale.edu/story/2022/over-1000-companies-have-curtailed-operations-russia-some-remain

Here is the summary about the dataset from its publishing team at Yale, "Since the invasion of Ukraine began, we have been tracking the responses of well over 1,200 companies, and counting. Over 1,000 companies have publicly announced they are voluntarily curtailing operations in Russia to some degree beyond the bare minimum legally required by international sanctions — but some companies have continued to operate in Russia undeterred.

Originally a simple "withdraw" vs. "remain" list, our list of companies now consists of five categories—graded on a school-style letter grade scale of A-F for the completeness of withdrawal.

The list below is updated continuously by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and his team of experts, research fellows, and students at the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute to reflect new announcements from companies in as close to real time as possible."

# Discussion of the Results Observed
We can see that the majority of the companies within the dataset is embarked on either full or significant exit from russia (yaleGrade = 'a' or 'b'). The relative fraction of such companies within G7 countries is much bigger then in the rest of the world. We can interprete it as an inclanation of the business elites within the global companies to support the values of democracy, freedom and non-tolerance to the state terrorism as opposed to the aggressive totalirism and terrorism manifested by russian aggression in Ukraine.

At the same time, we observe the cluster of countries that tend to either support russian aggression , whether directly or indirectly (like China), or simply get short-term benefits from operating in the russian markets at the time of the massive exodus of the global players from it (India, Brasil, and some of EU countries that see the post-war world order to be WITH RUSSIA rather then AGAINST RUSSIA - Italy, France, and, to less and less extent over time, Germany).

In terms of the industries, we see that

- the biggest clusters of the companies that followed the exodus from russia are 'grade b - Consumer Discretionary - G7', 'grade b - Consumer Discretionary - Other countries', 'grade b - Information Technology - G7', 'grade b - Industrials - G7', 'grade b - Industrials - Other companies', and 'grade a - Industrials - G7'
- the biggest clusters of the companies that decided to stay in russia is 'grade f - Industrials - Other companies'

At the same time, we can see that many decisions (especially in Energy and Financials) are dictated by political reasos of 'real politics' rather then by value-driven decisions of the top managers of the respective countries. For example,

- Chineese and Indian financial institutions/companies have to massively exit from russia due the risk of being exposed to the secondary sanctions of the US, UK, and EU
- Relatively big percentage of Western companies in the Energy industry that decided to continue their operations in russia are driven by the nature of oil/gas production, factored in by the politically-driven decisions ( (1) capping the top price of the Urals oil and gas produced in russia; (2) limitations to the nuclear energy operations with/in russia; (3) collateral financial restrictions toward the energy-related transactions with russian companies etc.).
- This report provides the comprehensive outline on HOW global companies work on their exodus from russia amid the cruel invasion and war it started in Ukraine. However, the data in the original Yale SOM dataset do not have sufficient infromation about WHY we see what we see.

There are both the value- and policy-driven factors that make an impact on the decision of the businesses to exit from russia amid its cruel aggression against Ukraine.
